# Microcontroller-driven-Feeding-Management-and-Automation-for-L.-vannamei-Shrimp-Aquaculture

Shrimp is highly valued in the seafood industry by many people worldwide. 

This study aims to properly designate the correct amount of shrimp feed based on sampling the shrimp farm in proportion to the age and weight of the L. vannamei and deploy
a system that will automate the proper feed distribution through the integration of microcontrollers. 

This study also includes a pond monitoring system to ensure that the pond’s water quality is adequate for the shrimp’s cultivated health and development. 
Theresearchers compare shrimp development in culture ponds using an automated feeder and a manual feeding approach to determine the efficiency or effectiveness of the computerized feeder for
managing feeds. The growth analysis is divided into two ponds (1 and 2). 
For measuring shrimp development, the automated feeder favored pond 1, whereas pond 2 for manual feeding. 

This study found that utilizing an auto feeder increased shrimp growth rates by ensuring they were adequately fed based on the average body weight of shrimp every sampling and made them healthier by
using sensors to monitor the pond’s water quality. 

The researchers successfully developed the automated feeder and tested it many times, obtaining a total accuracy of 96.21%.


The design involved three parts of the mechanical system: the shrimp feeds container, automated supporting system, and
disseminator—the shrimp feed container designed with two parts. 
The first part is the container attached to the second part (mechanical supportive system).

Detailed Outcomes During Culture Period

According to the findings of this study, more efficient feeding management through daily feeding quantity, effective feed distribution, and interval of feeding about the frequency
utilizing automatic feeders would promote continuous shrimp development. 
Feeding management using an automated feeder should provide the lowest FCR to maximize shrimp development and minimize feed waste accumulation at the
pond bottom. 
Increasing feed efficiency through lower FCR iscritical for shrimp farmers to reduce costs and maximize profits.
